Applying this method removes the layout physically from the collection of layout definitions. This can only be done, if the currently logged-in user is allowed to delete the layout in question. If the user does not have the right to delete the layout, a corresponding error message will be thrown. Users usually can only delete layouts created by themselves.

Termbase oTb = oTbs["Termbase name"];

//select layout
LayoutDefinitions oLayouts = oTb.LayoutDefinitions;
LayoutDefinition oLayout=oLayouts["My own layout"];
oLayout.Delete();
```
