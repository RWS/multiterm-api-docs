*none*


## Description



Rather than searching only in a single termbase, MultiTerm allows you to cascade searches over several termbases, which can both be local and remote server termbases. This is why the MultiSearch class is sub-ordinate to the MultiTerm client application class, as it is not limited to the local or server termbase repository.
