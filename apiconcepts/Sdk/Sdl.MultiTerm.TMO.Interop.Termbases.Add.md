## Description



This method can only be applied to a local termbase repository. It is the programmatic equivalent of the "Open" command in MultiTerm.  It is used to  provide access to local termbases stored in JET format (\*.sdltb) via the local termbase repository.

This method requires the full path of the \*.sdltb file. It is then available  within the Termbases collection, and can be access via its full path as its  name.



## Sample


```cs
TermbaseRepository oLocalRep = oMt.LocalRepository;	
oLocalRep.Connect("", "");		

Termbases oTbs = oLocalRep.Termbases;

oTbs.Add("C:\\temp\\mytermbase.sdltb", "", "");

oTB = oTbs.Item("C:\\temp\\mytermbase.sdltb");
```
