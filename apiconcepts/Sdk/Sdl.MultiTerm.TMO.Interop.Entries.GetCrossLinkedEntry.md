A cross-link is made up of the index name the cross-linked term belongs to, the actual cross-linked term and the display text. The display text is often identical to the cross-linked term.

The GetCrossLinkedEntry method requires the index, the cross-linked term and the current entry id as parameters. The method returns the content of the entry that contains the cross-linked entry as an XML stream.


## Sample


```cs
//select termbase
Termbase oTb = oTbs["Termbase name"];
Entries oEntries = oTb.Entries;

//current entry has entry #1
Entry thisEntry = oEntries.Item(1);
//output content of cross-linked entry
Debug.Write(oEntries.GetCrossLinkedEntry("English", "starship", 17));
```
